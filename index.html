      <h1> Welcome to Build-a-mind where our mission is to help you embrace the
      brighter side of things with a positive attitude for a better change.</h1> <br>
       <img src="build-a-mind.jpg" alt="photo"> <h2> OUR PURPOSE </h2>
        <h3>     We at build-a-mind want to create a more optimistic and hopeful
        attitude for people of the community who feel negatively about change
        before it even takes place. With how much we need change in the society
        why not openly embrace it with a positive mind and a positive smile. We believe that if we continue to percieve everything in a negative manner it proves the theory that we make life and difficult for not only our community
          but the world in general, as negativity has proved to be some of the major casues of war, disputes and many more social challenges.
           Our way of solving this issue is by creating this platform as way to see things from a happier or better side of things,while also
            providing you a platform to speak whatever you feel, assure or agree with your own thoughts through affirmations and gain a new perspective on how you
            or the community see an issue from all sides of the view as well as give advice when needed.</h3>
            <h2> OUR MISSION </h2>
<h3> Our mission is give back the community the positivity it needs.
  We believe in blowing away that bluey feeling of negativity and placing a smile on people's face With a much better
  better positive attitude towards change, even to yourself when you feel that you need some upifting in your head.</h3>
